Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project, Final Assignment Course 3 of 10 in the Data Science Specialization

This repository has the instructions on how to run analysis on the ‘Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set’. Abstract: The Human Activity Recognition database is built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

Here are the data for the project:

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#

Files:
•	CodeBook.md to describe the data, variables and the manipulation to get a tidy dataset
•	Run_analysis.R script to solve the required steps in the project task;
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
•	Tidy2_2.txt is the final data set required in no5 above
